# The Jumia devops challenge
## About this project
<p>
This repository contains all the required application code, infrastructure code and configuration code to seamlessly automate <br/>
   Infrastructure provision, configuration and application containers deployments within the AWS cloud platform. <br/>
   It is to a high degree safe for 'production-ready' scenarios, however few tweaks can be made to cater for varying enterprise use cases.
